  distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its
  layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
  more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
  'Content here, content here', making it look like readable
  English. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined
  with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem
  Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is
  therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or
  non-characteristic words etc. There are many variations of
  passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have
  suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or
  randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If
  you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be
  sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of
